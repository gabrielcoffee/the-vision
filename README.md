# the-vision
Source code for my software agency website.

You can visit it here: https://thevision.software/

This website was built using only HTML, CSS AND Javascript.
Since it's a simple project I didn't think using a more robust framework like React would be necessary, although if I think about scaling this a little bit more than just a landing page for my business I would probably switch to using React.

This project is not meant for contributions but I wanted leave it public just to show some front end on my part.
